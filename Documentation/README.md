**When to use:** Before declaring a release fully shipped — cannot be verified on macOS

---

### Local-E2E-Test.md
**Purpose:** Full-stack Enterprise server E2E on a developer machine (macOS or
Linux) before deploying — the same steps transfer verbatim to the Ubuntu VM

**Covers:**
- `deploy.sh` bring-up (identical macOS + Linux)
- First-run web setup (company / admin / GitHub remote-build with full-URL repo)
- Simulated agent via curl (heartbeat + ingest + command round-trip)
- Portal verification checklist (Agents/Fleet/Events/Software/Commands/Alerts)
- Automated pytest suite + notes on reusing the flow on the Ubuntu VM

**When to use:** Before touching a real server — proves the server path end-to-end
from a Mac or Linux box when the Windows agent isn't available

---

### PROJECT-SPEC.md
**Purpose:** Clean-room conceptual specification of the entire platform —
concept-first description of all three layers (base toolkit, enterprise agent,
server/portal) with design-level contracts and acceptance checks

**Covers:**
- Part 0 — design philosophy + how contracts are written
- Parts 1–3 — toolkit, agent (collectors + lifecycle), server (data model, API,
  portal, F4 multi-tenant, alerts, F3 software, GitHub remote build)
- Part 4 — deployment (deploy.sh/deploy.ps1, build modes, env contract)
- Part 5 — security model
- Part 6 — per-layer acceptance checklist (anti-hallucination anchor)

**When to use:** Handing the project to a developer/AI agent to rebuild fresh
without inheriting existing implementation bugs — or as a design reference

---

### Enterprise/ (Phase 3 — client-server stack)
**Purpose:** Centralized agent → server → web-portal layer. Additive, zero changes to the existing toolkit.

**Docs:**
- `Enterprise/README.md` — quick start (intranet/LAN deploy, agent + MSI build, SaaS auto-setup, GitHub remote build)
- `Enterprise/ARCHITECTURE.md` — full blueprint (zero-change guarantee, data model, security, migration)
- `Enterprise/ROADMAP.md` — phased plan + status (P0–P6 done, Rev 3 SaaS auto-setup)

**Covers:**
- `Enterprise/deploy/deploy.sh` — one-command bring-up, **LAN-first**, `--regen` / `--public`
- `Enterprise/deploy/deploy.ps1` — Windows Server bring-up **+ local MSI build/sign/publish** (`BUILD_MODE=local_windows`)
- `Enterprise/agent/Agent-Collect.ps1` → `.exe` (ps2exe) + `.msi` (WiX); auto-installs the server CA into `LocalMachine\Root`
- `Enterprise/api/` (FastAPI: `/ingest`, `/api/*`, `/api/build/*` for remote GitHub builds) + `docker-compose.yml` (db+api+caddy, one DB)
- `Enterprise/portal/` — admin UI (Agents / Events / Feature config editor / Agent Setup with build panel)
- Auto-generated secrets (API token + Postgres password) — no manual setup

**When to use:** Before/introducing fleet telemetry, remote log collection, or web-based admin.
