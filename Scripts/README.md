---

## Configuration & Customization

### Editing Script Behavior
All scripts read from **Config\config.json** on startup:

```json
{
  "scriptDefaults": {
    "deleteOldLogsAfterDays": 90,
    "maxLogSize_MB": 100,
    "adminRequired": {
      "PrinterFix": true,
      "UserInventory": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Custom Test Hosts (Firewall-Test)
Edit config.json:
```json
"firewallTest": {
  "customPorts": [
    {
      "name": "Company VPN",
      "host": "vpn.company.com",
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "TCP"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 1 Reporting and Cleanup
The toolkit now includes Phase 1 export and cleanup support:
- `alertThresholds` for disk, memory, and CPU alert checks
- `logRetention` for automated log cleanup
- `scriptParameters` for tool-specific runtime values
- `Export-ToCSV`, `Export-ToJSON`, and `New-HTMLReport` are available for supported scripts
- Full health checks and diagnostics now save summary exports to the Logs folder

Example config additions:
```json
"alertThresholds": {
  "diskUsagePercent": 85,
  "memoryUsagePercent": 80,
  "cpuUsagePercent": 90,
  "diskFillDays": 7
},
"logRetention": {
  "retentionDays": 90,
  "maxLogsSizeMB": 500,
  "autoCleanup": true
},
"scriptParameters": {
  "networkDiagnosticTimeoutMs": 2000,
  "userInventoryMaxApplications": 50,
  "firewallTestTimeoutMs": 2000
}
```

### Notes
- `QuickCheck.ps1` loads and applies log cleanup automatically at startup.
- Diagnostics scripts export summary data to CSV, JSON, and HTML when the Phase 1 modules are available.

### Customizing Event Log Export
Edit config.json:
```json
"eventLogSettings": {
  "exportSources": ["System", "Application", "Security"],
  "daysToExport": 7,
  "maxEventsPerSource": 500
}
```

## Troubleshooting Scripts

### "Execution Policy" Error
If you see: "PowerShell cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system"

**Fix:**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`
3. Type `Y` to confirm
4. Try script again

### Script Hangs/Freezes
**Common causes:**
- Scanning large number of applications (User-Inventory)
- Waiting for network timeout (Firewall-Test)

**Solution:** 
- Wait 2-3 minutes, or Ctrl+C to cancel
- Adjust timeouts in config.json

### Logs Not Saved
**Check:**
1. Verify Logs folder exists: `Logs/`
2. Check folder permissions (write access required)
3. Verify config.json paths are correct

### "Access Denied" Errors
Some scripts need admin:
- **Printer-Fix:** Always needs admin (auto-elevates)
- **Export-EventLogs:** Needs admin for Security logs
- **User-Inventory:** Works standard, enhanced with admin

**Solution:** Right-click script → "Run as Administrator"

## Script Development Notes

### Common Issues to Report
If you find a bug or issue:
1. Run script in PowerShell directly (not batch wrapper)
2. Note exact error message
3. Check Event Viewer for related errors
4. Include: OS version, error code, what you were doing

### Extending Scripts
All scripts are designed to be modified:
- Well-commented code
- Configurable via config.json
- Modular functions
- Standard PowerShell practices
